To grant an optimal user experience, you have to consider three possible contexts:
AMP page AMP page with blocked JavaScript (no AMP runtime execution) AMP page in AMP Viewer (such as Google's) Usually, the first two contexts are not a big problem. The last one is.

For now, it is a Tech-Blog that respects your privacy with a strong focus on Software and Hardware projects.

Imagine the following scenario:
Your PC gets compromised. You do not notice it. You secured your wallet with a password which is sufficient? Does not matter, the attacker installed a keylogger. He only needs to sniff your password next time you do a transaction.

Tired of old batch scripts? The PowerShell does have some really nice and powerful features.</description></item><item><title>Mod a SNES Gamepad</title><link>https://pyotek.dev/p/snes-ctrl-mod/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2016 01:14:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pyotek.dev/p/snes-ctrl-mod/</guid><description>Ever wanted to make a SNES gamepad wireless?
