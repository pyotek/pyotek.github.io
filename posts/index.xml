      <description>Why do you need a cold wallet for your Bitcoins? Imagine the following scenario:
Your PC gets compromised. You do not notice it. You secured your wallet with a password which is sufficient? Does not matter, the attacker installed a keylogger. He only needs to sniff your password next time you do a transaction.
Because the attacker is friendly enough (and because this is a theoretic scenario), he only stole 1 BTC out of your wallet and left a note on your desktop:</description>

      <description>The idea File Hashing is the correct way to determine data integrity of your downloads and more. Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s practical to have built-in OS capabilities to hash files.
The PowerShell provides a nice and easy-to-use way to do that - the Get-FileHash Utility Cmdlet. That&amp;rsquo;s right: File-Hashing with MD5 and various SHA&amp;hellip; variants ready to use in Windows!
Tired of old batch scripts? The PowerShell does have some really nice and powerful features.</description>

      <description>Ever wanted to make a SNES gamepad wireless? Read on!
Introduction This project description shows how I modified a SNES USB Gamepad/Controller to make it work wirelessly (frequency: 2.4 GHz) by combining it with a wireless keyboard.
I mostly used XodusTech&amp;rsquo;s site as a starting point. The site helped me with understanding how to marry the gamepad with the keyboard&amp;rsquo;s 2.4 GHz transmitter, so you probably want to visit it, too.</description>
