      <description>Intro Playing PC games from the couch on a bigger screen is fun.
But it requires additional steps, especially if the external bigger (TV) screen is not your primary display:
 Switch your display (this can be done by pressing WIN+P) Start Steam or another gaming platform (e.g. in Big Picture mode)   Hey, those are just 2 additional steps, so what&amp;rsquo;s the deal?
 Personally, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to wait until the PC is fully started to setup everything.</description>

      <description>The idea File Hashing is the correct way to determine data integrity of your downloads and more. Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s practical to have built-in OS capabilities to hash files.
The PowerShell provides a nice and easy-to-use way to do that - the Get-FileHash Utility Cmdlet. That&amp;rsquo;s right: File-Hashing with MD5 and various SHA&amp;hellip; variants ready to use in Windows!
Tired of old batch scripts? The PowerShell does have some really nice and powerful features.</description>
