On the other hand, it is also a GitHub organization/collective (yeah, currently a one-man show) that works on Open Source projects.

Imagine the following scenario:
Your PC gets compromised. You do not notice it. You secured your wallet with a password which is sufficient? Does not matter, the attacker installed a keylogger. He only needs to sniff your password next time you do a transaction.
Because the attacker is friendly enough (and because this is a theoretic scenario), he only stole 1 BTC out of your wallet and left a note on your desktop:</description></item><item><title>Donations</title><link>https://pyotek.co/donate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2016 00:50:13 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pyotek.co/donate/</guid><description>Donate via &amp;nbsp; Donate â‚¿itcoin&amp;nbsp; Donate Îžther&amp;nbsp;

Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s practical to have built-in OS capabilities to hash files.
The PowerShell provides a nice and easy-to-use way to do that - the Get-FileHash Utility Cmdlet. That&amp;rsquo;s right: File-Hashing with MD5 and various SHA&amp;hellip; variants ready to use in Windows!
Tired of old batch scripts? The PowerShell does have some really nice and powerful features.</description></item><item><title>Mod a SNES Gamepad</title><link>https://pyotek.co/p/snes-ctrl-mod/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2016 01:14:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pyotek.co/p/snes-ctrl-mod/</guid><description>Ever wanted to make a SNES gamepad wireless? Read on!
Introduction This project description shows how I modified a SNES USB Gamepad/Controller to make it work wirelessly (frequency: 2.4 GHz) by combining it with a wireless keyboard.
I mostly used XodusTech&amp;rsquo;s site as a starting point. The site helped me with understanding how to marry the gamepad with the keyboard&amp;rsquo;s 2.4 GHz transmitter, so you probably want to visit it, too.</description></item><item><title>Hyde License (2016-08-07)</title><link>https://pyotek.co/licenses/hyde/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2016 16:13:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pyotek.co/licenses/hyde/</guid><description>Released under MIT License Copyright &amp;copy; 2013 Mark Otto.
